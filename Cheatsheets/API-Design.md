- **REST** - Representational State Transfer - is an architectural style to be used for creating web services. Support JSON and XML formats.
  - Separation of Client and Server - if code change, doesn't affect other side.
  - Statelessness - the server does not need to know anything about what state of the client
  - Communication between Client and Server
- **API** (Application Programming Interface) - way of communication between programs.
- **HTTP request** -
  - Verb − Indicate HTTP methods such as GET, POST, DELETE, PUT etc.
  - URI − Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to identify the resource on server.
  - HTTP Version − Indicate HTTP version, for example HTTP v1.1 .
  - Request Header − Contains metadata for the HTTP Request message as key-value pairs.
  - Request Body − Message content or Resource representation.
- **SOA** - Service Oriented Architecture - uses services to create applications
- **Cashed response** - storing server response in client, so no need to make server request for same resource again.
- **Web service** - set of protocols and standards
  - SOAP Web Services: Runs on SOAP protocol and uses XML technology for sending data.
  - Restful Web Services: It’s an architectural style and runs on HTTP/HTTPS protocol over the web.
    - Interoperability: Web services are accessible over network
    - Reusability: One web service can be used by many client applications at the same time.
    - Loose Coupling: Web services client code is totally independent with server code, so we have achieved loose coupling in our application.
    - Easy to deploy and integrate, just like web applications.
    - Multiple service versions can be running at same time.
- **SOAP** - Simple Object Access Protocol - messaging protocol specification to crate API design. Highly structured, uses XML data format.
- **WebSocket** Communications protocol, providing a simultaneous two-way communication.
- **UDDI** - Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration. Standard for describing, publishing, and finding web services.
