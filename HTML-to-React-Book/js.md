## JavaScript as Object-Oriented Programming language

- **Encapsulation** :
- **Aggregation** :

```
A "uses" B = Aggregation : B exists independently (conceptually) from A.
Let say we have objects: address, student, teacher
We want to specify student address and teacher address
Then we can reuse address between student and teacher
```

- **Composition** :

```
A "owns" B = Composition : B has no meaning or purpose in the system without A
```

- **Inheritance** :

```
class Car { }
class Honda extends Car { }
```

- **Polymorphism** :

## truthy and falsy - everything has inherent boolean values

- **falsy**(false, 0, "", null, undefined, NaN)
- **truthy**("0","false", function () {} , [], {} )

## Loops

- For Loop => array
- For-In loop => object => object keys
- For-Of loop => object => object values
- While loop
- Do-While loop
